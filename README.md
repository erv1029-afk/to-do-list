Welcome to my React Todo List lab! This assignment challenged me to build a fully functional todo list application from scratch, using React and the principles of "Thinking in React" to guide my design decisions. The goal: modular, teachable code that’s as expressive as it is resilient.

🎯 Lab Objectives
• 	Build a React app named "React Todo List" in CodeSandbox
• 	Implement core functionality:
• 	A heading to label the app
• 	A list of todos with:
• 	✅ Checkbox to mark completion
• 	🗑️ Delete button (disabled unless complete)
• 	✏️ Edit button that toggles a text input
• 	💾 Save button to confirm edits
• 	➕ Input field to add new todos (added to the top!)
• 	Bonus stretch: Fetch initial data from the JSONPlaceholder API

🧠 Design Philosophy
I approached this lab with a modular mindset, breaking down the UI into manageable components and binding state thoughtfully to ensure clarity and control. Each interaction—editing, saving, deleting—was scaffolded with care to support future learners and maintain a cozy, intuitive user experience.

🛠️ Features Implemented
• 	Dynamic todo list with real-time state updates
• 	Conditional rendering for edit/save modes
• 	Disabled delete button until a task is complete (because we don’t toss unfinished dreams!)
• 	Input field for new todos, always added to the top
• 	Clean, readable layout with room for styling flair

🌱 Stretch Goals Explored
• 	[ ] Fetching initial todos from JSONPlaceholder API
• 	[ ] Styling enhancements for accessibility and drama

💡 Reflections
This lab was a great exercise in state management, conditional rendering, and user-centered design. I focused on making the code modular and expressive, with clear logic and thoughtful UX decisions. Every button, input, and checkbox tells a little story—and that’s the kind of development I love.
